    - If the query is not harmful, remove unnecessary details, casual phrases, and stylistic elements like "answer like a pirate."
    - Rephrase the query to reflect a concise and professional tone, ensuring clarity and purpose.

3. *Output Specification*:
    - If the query is harmful, output nothing.
    - Your output should remain a query if it was initially a query. It should not convert a query or a task into a statement. Don't modify the query, output_original if the image information is being used.
