### üß™ Few-Shot Examples

#### Example 1:
Can you summarize the recent Q4 earnings of NVIDIA? I want to understand how their margins evolved this quarter and what their guidance looks like.

```json
{
  "company_name": "NVIDIA",
  "industry": "Semiconductors",
  "country": "USA",
  "financial_metric": "margins, earnings, guidance",
  "type_of_analysis": "Equity Research",
  "time_period": "Q4",
  "date": null
}
```

#### Example 2:
I'm evaluating a Series A startup in the edtech space. Can you help build an investment memo focusing on market size, traction, and team?

```json
{
  "company_name": null,
  "industry": "EdTech",
  "country": null,
  "financial_metric": "market size, traction",
  "type_of_analysis": "VC",
  "time_period": null,
  "date": null
}
```

#### Example 3:
What's your take on the European energy sector given current macro trends? Especially post-COVID growth and ESG investment flows.

```json
{
  "company_name": null,
  "industry": "Energy",
  "country": "Europe",
  "financial_metric": "growth trends, ESG flows",
  "type_of_analysis": "Sector Analysis",
  "time_period": "post-COVID",
  "date": null
}
```

#### Example 4:
Please analyze Tesla‚Äôs Q2 2023 10-Q and compare it with Ford‚Äôs to evaluate their operational risks.

```json
{
  "company_name": "Tesla, Ford",
  "industry": "Automotive",
  "country": "USA",
  "financial_metric": "operational risks",
  "type_of_analysis": "Equity Research",
  "time_period": "Q2 2023",
  "date": "2023-06-30"
}
```

#### Example 5:

We‚Äôre assessing a bolt-on acquisition in the specialty chemicals space. Can you provide comps and recent deal multiples?

```json
{
  "company_name": null,
  "industry": "Specialty Chemicals",
  "country": null,
  "financial_metric": "deal multiples",
  "type_of_analysis": "PE",
  "time_period": null,
  "date": null
}
```

Once you have extracted the metadata and identified the `type_of_analysis`, rewrite and expand the user‚Äôs original query into a deeper, multi-layered research request.

The goal is to:
- Frame the right questions a financial analyst would ask in this context
- Enrich the original prompt by suggesting relevant data to pull (competitors, market size, recent filings, KPIs, risks)
- Transform it into an actionable research pipeline prompt

The final output should include:
1. The original query
2. A structured, enhanced version titled: `Expanded Research Prompt`
3. The updated goal: `Research Objective`

---

Use the following logic for expansion:

### If `type_of_analysis` = **VC**:
- Add: market size (TAM), product-market fit, traction metrics, team background, funding history, competitor scan, tech stack or product differentiation, regulatory risks

### If `type_of_analysis` = **PE**:
- Add: historical financial performance, EBITDA margins, operational KPIs, cost optimization opportunities, industry multiples, LBO suitability, downside risks

### If `type_of_analysis` = **IB**:
- Add: comparable deals, DCF inputs, strategic rationale, valuation comps (EV/EBITDA, revenue multiples), M&A precedent transactions, investor interest

### If `type_of_analysis` = **Equity Research**:
- Add: earnings summaries, analyst expectations vs actuals, valuation metrics, guidance analysis, management commentary, stock trends

### If `type_of_analysis` = **Sector Analysis**:
- Add: industry macro trends, regulatory landscape, leading players, growth drivers, recent disruptions, funding trends, performance benchmarks
