**Product Requirements Document (PRD): Frontend Architecture for AI-Powered Financial Research Assistant**

---

### Project Name:
AI Research Assistant – Frontend (ReactJS + FastAPI Backend)

### Purpose:
To build an interactive web-based frontend interface for an AI-powered financial research assistant, enabling users to generate detailed reports through chat, upload files/filings, and collaborate in shared workspaces.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend Framework**: ReactJS
- **Backend API**: FastAPI (separate backend service)
- **Charting Library**: Chart.js or Recharts
- **Table Component**: React Table
- **State Management**: Context API (or Redux for scalability)
- **Routing**: React Router

---

## Pages & Features

### 1. **Home Page**
**Route**: `/`
- Hero section with app overview
- CTA buttons: "Start Chat", "Upload Filing", "Join Workspace"
- Short demo of app capabilities (carousel or video block)
- Login/Signup button (placeholder for dummy auth)

---

### 2. **Chat Page**
**Route**: `/chat`
- Left sidebar with chat history (stored locally or via API)
- Main chat interface (ChatGPT-style):
  - Input box for user prompt
  - Display area for messages (both user and assistant)
  - Chat messages may include:
    - **Text blocks** (Markdown styled)
    - **Tables** (generated by backend, rendered via custom component)
    - **Graphs** (inline chart components using JSON/chart configs)
    - **Images** (e.g., uploaded charts or visuals from backend)
- Streaming support for ChatGPT response (optional)
- Button to "Export as Report" (PDF/Markdown)

---

### 3. **Filings/File Upload Page**
**Route**: `/upload`
- Upload area for PDF, TXT, DOCX, or CSV files
- Metadata fields (e.g., Company Name, Report Type)
- Upload button -> sends data to FastAPI endpoint
- Show processing status and success message
- Link to go directly to Chat page with uploaded data context

---

### 4. **Workspace Page**
**Route**: `/workspace/:workspaceId`
- Workspace dashboard
  - Name of workspace
  - Members list (with dummy names/emails)
  - Invite user (dummy input, adds mock user to local state)
  - Activity feed (chat summaries, file uploads, etc.)
  - Shortcut to open group chat or upload shared docs
- Sidebar for switching between workspaces

---

### 5. **Authentication (Dummy)**
**Routes**: `/login`, `/signup`
- Simple login/signup forms
- No real auth logic — store user data in localStorage
- Allow simulation of multi-user by switching users
- Redirect to home/chat after login

---

## Component-Level Breakdown

### Shared Components
- `Navbar` – Global navigation
- `Sidebar` – For chat/workspace navigation
- `ChatBubble` – Renders each message
- `GraphRenderer` – Displays chart from JSON config
- `TableRenderer` – Renders table from backend JSON
- `UserCard` – Shows user info in workspace
- `UploadBox` – Drag-and-drop + file input

---

## Integration with Backend (FastAPI)
- `POST /chat`: Send prompt and get assistant response
- `POST /upload`: Upload file for processing
- `GET /chat-history`: Fetch past conversations
- `GET /workspace/:id`: Get workspace data
- `POST /workspace/:id/invite`: Add dummy user

---

## Notes
- Focus on modular design and scalable structure
- Start with static UI, then integrate API
- Use mock data initially for workspaces and chat content
- Graph and table support should be dynamic and react to message content
- Prepare for multi-user extensions in future (real auth, DB)

---

## Milestones
1. Setup React Project + Routing
2. Build UI for Home, Chat, Upload, Workspace
3. Add dummy auth
4. Connect Chat with FastAPI
5. Enable file upload to backend
6. Dynamic graph and table rendering
7. Workspace mock support
8. Export report feature
